# GEOG5995_project
Independent Project Assignment

This respository of code contains the python code for the independent project as part of the Leeds GEOG5995 module. The code follows the 'White Star Line' project. This project is part of an introductary course in order to learn the python programming language. This particular project is independent and the code has been written by myself following the guidelines for the White Star Line project.

Two python code files are uploaded. The first is the basic code as is required for the pracical. The steps for the model are as follows:

1. The model 

The second of the files is the same code with the added radar and lidar files, which includes an additional four icebergs.

How I could work on this code to improve efficiency:
Currently there is a lot of repetition of code in order to calculate the mass of each of the five icebergs. To develop this code and reduce run time and improve efficiency, it would be beneficial to utilise functions. This would reduce the repetition of code, reducing the code down to fewer lines, making it easier to read and run quicker.
