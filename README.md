# GEOG5995_project
Independent Project Assignment

This respository of code contains the python code for the independent project as part of the Leeds GEOG5995 module. The code follows the 'White Star Line' project. This project is part of an introductary course in order to learn the python programming language. This particular project is independent and the code has been written by myself following the guidelines for the White Star Line project.

Themodel should work as follows:

1. The model imports all the relevant modules needed for the code to run
2. Empty lists are created in order for values to be added to the lists throughout the code

How the code is tested:
The code is timed for efficiency
The code has commented out sections that can be turned on to display coordinates and values to the output to show that the code is working correctly 

How I could work on this code to improve efficiency and make it more advanced:
Utilise more functions to shrink code
Import data for multiple icebergs and determine which ones could be moved and which couldn't - functions could also be utilised in order to make this process more efficent and shrink the number of lines of code needed.
